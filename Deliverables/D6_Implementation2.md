## Code Quality
Our team ensured code quality through a rigorous code review process, requiring at least two team members to examine each piece of code before merging. We enforced coding standards and used automated tools like linters in our CI/CD pipeline to maintain consistency. Comprehensive unit and integration tests were mandated for each new feature and bug fix to secure stability and high test coverage. Detailed documentation for all major functions and modules was required to enhance maintainability and scalability. Regular coding sessions promoted continuous learning and adherence to best practices within the team.

## Lessons learned
During our second release, our team learned the importance of more thorough initial testing phases, which revealed that early bug detection significantly streamlines later development stages. We realized that clearer communication among team members could further reduce misunderstandings and improve implementation efficiency. Reflecting on tool integration, we found that more advanced automated testing tools could further enhance our CI/CD pipeline by catching subtle issues earlier. If we were to continue developing the project, we would implement a more robust pre-release testing regimen to catch and resolve issues before they affect the production environment. We would also invest in training to improve team collaboration and communication skills, ensuring smoother project progression. Additionally, upgrading our toolset for automation would be a priority to keep pace with the latest in technology advancements and best practices.
